- Cu.bsv: 
//FIXME: we use an output FIFO here, but its possible for results from diff rows of PEs
// to be out of order. Especially if the # of MACs is small (e.g. <16). 
// The true fix should be a completion buffer. Using a FIFO for convenience for now. 

- BankedBRAMCache:
//TODO FIXME: Currently assumes response always drains and fixed latency BRAM. 
// Otherwise we may have out-of-orderness, which may need tags/completion bufs. 
// The way this cache is used.. we can't guarantee non-blocking output

//Writeback:
- conflicting rules to writeback to dram is not resolved

- Speed up sim compiles using verilog/verilator sim
- test CUArray with control
